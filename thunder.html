          <section>

            <p>As someone who takes his physical fitness very seriously, I am constantly trying new fitness applications to supplement my training. The current ecosystem on mobile app stores is trending towards specialised applications, aimed at solving one problem and making a lot of decisions on behalf of the user, for example cardio apps with preset runs, or lifting apps with predefined regimens.</p>

            <p>While these are great for beginners, changing the options within them can difficult when the time comes to develop a tailored workout plan. This can be a result of limited choices or a bloated application that makes operating it confusing. Because of this, I wanted to develop a simple tool that the user could utilise however they wished.</p>

            <a href="http://thunder.kayra.co.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="resources/images/thunder_use.png"></a>

            <p>Thunder lets a user create a custom workout of any kind. They can then use the timer to keep track of their workout. This allows a wider variety of possibilities than currently available in fitness applications, while keeping the operation of the app simple enough that it is convenient to use.  One example is creating a 5km high intensity training run. Along side this the user can create a 30 minute stretch routine for flexibility. Users can even enter exercise classes such as Zumba or Insanity to take with them and tailor to their own needs. </p>

            <a href="http://thunder.kayra.co.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="resources/images/thunder_edit.png"></a>

            <p>The application is split into two halves; the back-end has been developed using the Django Rest-Framework, and the front-end has been created with the Angular.js framework. While I feel the app has been a successful proof of concept, there are still many features I’d like to add before I would consider it a finished product. I would also like to create a native iOS application, as I believe a native app would provide a higher quality experience that can’t be matched by a web application. Additionally, it would give me the opportunity to learn how to develop on a new platform that I am interested in.</p>
